This is the readme for the python tutorial series!

In order to begin the tutorial, we need to install some tools for interpreting python and getting the lectures.
We will use GitBash in order to retrieve this code repository.
We will be using PyCharm, a python Integrated Design Environment (IDE).

Installing GitBash and retrieving lecture repository (cloning repository):
    1. Go to the GitBash homepage: https://gitforwindows.org/
    2. Press Download
    3. Open the .exe file
    4. "Yes" to make changes to your device
    5. Next -> Next -> Next -> Next -> Next -> Select the option which is (Recommended)
        -> Next -> Next -> Next -> Use MinTTY -> Install
    6. After Installation ~ 1 min: Select "Launch Git Bash" -> Next
    7. Now we must change to the folder location we want to run the tutorial.
        - The best option / easiest is to just put it on your desktop
        - In the terminal type "cd ~/Desktop" (if you know terminal commands, you can put it in a different spot)
        - paste this into the terminal and press enter:
                git clone https://github.com/mjadiletta/learnToCodePython.git
    8. Type "exit"
    9. Congrats! You just cloned your first git repository!
        Open a file explorer and check to see if the folder "learnToCodePython" is on your desktop.
        Go to "solutions/8_cumulativeProject2SolutionsImages/test_sigmoid.png" and make sure the image is viewable

Installing PyCharm:
    1. Go to the PyCharm homepage: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
    2. Press Download - will navigate you to a a Download PyCharm page
    3. Download the Community Edition by pressing the black download button - should take ~15s
    4. Open the .exe file
    5. Choose "yes" if the option appears
    6. Next -> Next -> Choose to create a desktop shortcut by selecting "64-bit launcher" -> Next -> Install - should take ~30s
    7. Finish

After PyCharm is installed, let's open it!
    Open PyCharm by going to your desktop and clicking on the new icon called "PyCharm"
    If you can't find it, search for it on your laptop using the windows search tool

    1. Do not import settings
    2. Confirm their Privacy Policy
    3. Continue
    4. Don't send
    5. Skip Remaining and Set Defaults (bottom left)
    6. Create New Project
        a. Select the folder icon on the far right of the "Location:" bar
        b. Navigate to this lecture series main directory and select
            If you followed the GitBash installation, then the folder you should select is:
                "C:\Users\username\Desktop\learnToCodePython"
    7. Click on Project Interpreter: New Virtualenv environment
        a. Make sure: "New environment using Virtualenv" is selected
        b. If there is a python interpreter that we can use, use it.
            -If Base Interpreter is "<No Interpreter>" and there is nothing in the dropdown
                -we will need to install python - Go go Installing Python below, then come back to this.

                WE BACK!

                - Hopefully we installed Python properly and know where it is installed
                    - if we don't know where it is installed open "Command Prompt" and type "where python"
                - click the "..." afer "Base interpreter"
                - click the eye icon in the menu bar to show hidden directories.
                    * it's the last icon inline with "Hide path"
                - navigate to the python.exe listed from "where python"
                    * Most likely in "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3_-__\python.exe"
            -Select Create!
    8. Close "Tip of the Day"
    9. Navigate to the left column window under "Project" select the highlighted folder.
    10. Select "lessons"
    11. Select "0_introductionToPython.py"
    12. In the menu bar, select "File" -> "Settings" -> "Project: learnToCode" -> "Project Interpreter"
        - This is the Project Interpreter where we can add python packages.
        - For this tutorial we need: numpy, matplotlib, and potentially more. We will install these for now
    13. Press the "+" button in the right column inline with "Package    Version    Latest Version" to open a new window.
    14. Search "numpy" in the search bar and press "Install Package".
        - If you get an error after doing everything before this... text me...
    15. Search "matplotlib" in the search bar and press "Install Package".
    16. You should be all set now! Read through lecture 0 carefully and begin your python journey!

Installing Python
    1. Check to see if your laptop already has python installed - just in case
    2. Press "start" and type "Command Prompt"
    3. In the Command Prompt type: "python --version"
        a. if "Python 3._._ " appears, then python is already installed
            - To find the location of it's installation which you can use in your PyCharm interpreter type: "where python"
            - Then go back to PyCharm and click the ... after "Base interpreter" and navigate to the path you found and click on python.exe
        b. if a blank line appears, then python isn't configured yet and we will need to configure it.
            - That's not to say, it isn't installed. It might not be in your environment variables yet
            - If you think you already installed python, go to "Adding Python to your Environment Variables"
    4. Since python isn't installed go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    5. Press the yellow "Download Python 3._._" in the "Download latest version for Windows" section.
    6. Open python.exe
    7. Select Add Python 3.8 to PATH !!!!!!!!!!!---Don't miss this or it'll be so annoying later---!!!!
    8. Press the blue "Install Now"
    9. Select "Yes" - should be ~1 minute
    10. Close
    11. Close the old "Command Prompt" and open a new one
    12. Type "python --version"
        a. "python 3.8.2" should now appear!
        b. If it doesn't, then python isn't installed correctly and it's not in your PATH.
           Go to Adding Python to your Environment Variables.
    13. Type "where python" and use this path for your python interpreter in PyCharm.


Adding Python to your Environment Variables
    Clearly we messed up somewhere, so there are two options, either try to reinstall python, or find it on your laptop
    and manually add python to your environment variables. This is no simple process... warning...
    - We most likely missed step 7 of Installing Python. If you remember selecting this, we might have bigger issues.
        * To double check python isn't installed:
            Close all windows
            Restart your laptop
            Open "Command Prompt"
            Type: "python --version"
                If it appears, then you can go back to the PyCharm Interpreter stuff
                If it doesn't... well lets continue...
    1. Open "File Explorer"
    2. Go to Window(C:)\Users\your username\
    3. Click "View" in the Menu bar
    4. In the "Show/hide" section, select "Hidden items"
    5. Select hidden folder "AppData"
    6. Search python.exe
    7. A path will appear eventually. Write down this path in a document somewhere.
        - should look something like this: "C:\Users\___\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3_\python.exe"
    8. Press Start and type "env" and select "Edit system environment variables"
    9. Press the "Environment Variables..." button
    10. Here we see two sections: "User variables for ___" and "System variables"
        - Each section should have a "Path" variable. Do the following for both
            - Double click on "Path"
            - Select "New"
            - Paste the path to python you wrote down earlier
            - press "OK"
        - press "OK"
    11. Press "OK"
    12. Exit out of all "Command Prompts"
    13. Open a new "Command Prompt"
    14. Type "python --version"
        - "python 3.8.2" should now appear!
        - If it doesn't, then text me! I'll have to really take a look
    15. Type "where python"
        - The path that appears should be the path you put in the "User" and "System" environment variables
    16. Go back to the PyCharm interpreter section and use this path for the "Base interpreter"
